The sand ortholinear keyboard was inpired by silicon, the element used to make semiconductor materials. The keyboard has 47 keys laid out in an ortholinear grid with a 2U spacebar. The board can be assembled with standoffs in between the backplate, the keyboard can be as short as 7.2mm tall (excluding switches and keycpas) or as tall as ~9.5mm with a 1/4" piece of acrylic sandwiched in between. I worked on this project from the end of July 2020 to September 2020.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Luke LaCasse](https://github.com/Sandpiper131)
* Hardware Supported: ATMEGA32-U4
* Hardware Availability: This is custom hardware and will not be run a second time, only five are in existence.
